# Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to review my project! I am a data scientist based in Toronto, Canada, and I appreciate your interest in my work.

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the average annual salaries of OECD countries for the year 2022. All salary figures have been adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to account for differences in the cost of living across countries, providing a more accurate comparison of wages.

It provides a forum where governments can collaborate to share experiences and find solutions to common challenges. The OECD collects and publishes a wide range of economic, social, and environmental data, aiding policymakers in making informed decisions.
